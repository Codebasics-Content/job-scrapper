 Semgrep is on a mission to make it expensive to exploit software. As the team behind the most popular SAST, we built the Semgrep AppSec Platform to deliver industry\-leading code, dependency, and secrets scanning to enable organizations to ship secure code quickly without slowing down development.
   

  

 With fast, customizable code analysis across large codebases, Semgrep helps teams catch vulnerabilities early and fix them faster. Leading companies like Snowflake, Plaid, Figma, Lyft, and Dropbox rely on Semgrep to secure their software.
   

  

 Semgrep is funded by top investors, including Felicis Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, and Sequoia Capital.
   

  

****About The Role****
 As a software engineering intern at Semgrep, you’ll help us build a new category of developer\-focused security tools to prevent bugs and security vulnerabilities. You will be joining the team behind the widely used Semgrep. You will get to ship features that make it easier for teams to integrate Semgrep into their existing workflows or build improvements that help our services scale and remain reliable.
   

  

 Along the way, you will work with a dedicated group of full\-stack developers, security researchers, program analysis experts, and infrastructure engineers. You will learn from senior developers who bring experience and wisdom from Google, Facebook, and successful startups. You will work with our clients’ security teams at companies ranging from early\-stage startups to social\-media giants. You will have opportunities to learn about their individual security philosophies and develop ways to make their lives easier. You’ll attend lunch and learn sessions across the company \- learning about everything from advanced type systems to product paradigms. As a member of our engineering team, you will get to speak directly with real customers who are using the features you build – something that makes interning at an early\-stage startup so unique! We’re excited to go on this journey with you!

 At Pulley, we are on a mission to help construction teams break ground faster. The United States is short between 4\-7 million homes while housing production and affordability remain near historic lows. Meanwhile, retail and office real estate are still adapting to the post\-pandemic world and the AI boom has led to significant investments in data center infrastructure.
   

  

 Permitting requirements vary vastly by jurisdiction, making it challenging to navigate for home builders, retailers, architects and contractors. It creates a critical bottleneck that every project must traverse.

 : if you’re outside of the Americas timezones, unfortunately, we’re only hiring for engineers with at least some timezone overlap.
   

  

 Wanderlog helps make leisure travel easier. We believe that travel makes the world better, and are building tools that lower the bar to it. Our core product, built starting 2019, is a travel planning app (we’re the top\-ranked trip planner on iOS and Android), but we’re also helping travelers book hotels (without hidden fees), providing them with information (through various pages on e.g., best attractions, restaurants, etc.), and more.
   

  

 Our founders are twin brothers. Peter worked as an engineer at Stripe and a consultant at McKinsey, and Harry as a product manager at Google. We’re an engineering and product\-driven team: the founders studied computer science at Yale, and have built successful, bootstrapped travel companies (BookWithMatrix and All the Flight Deals) with products people love before starting Wanderlog.
   

  

 We now serve millions of travelers a month, and are a team of 6, including 5 engineers hailing from Yale, University of Toronto, UCLA, and more; and 1 designer. We’re a self\-sustaining, default\-alive startup.
   

  

 We also love traveling. Whether it’s a short hop to Austin, Seattle, or New Orleans; or a longer jaunt to Australia, Hawaii, or Banff National Park (all places the team’s traveled to in the past year!), travel broadens our horizons, builds empathy, and challenges us to grow. We’re working to bring these experiences to more of the world.
   

  

**What You’ll Do**
 As an engineer, you’ll be responsible for owning portions of the product. You’ll be expected to:
   

  

* Build new features on our website and mobile app. (Our stack is Javascript (Typescript): modern React on the web, React Native on mobile, and Node.js/Express on the server.)
* Design and decide what to build based on what would help travelers and drive growth. You won’t be handed a spec; you’ll be coming up with it!
* Build data pipelines to crawl, process, and synthesize data from various sources around the web.
* Write tests and and build out engineering infrastructure. Our code is fully typed (Typescript) and tested.
* Debug and fix bugs and scale the infrastructure as it grows.
* Review code written by other engineers.
* Be fast and nimble: figure out the best way to build new features at lowest cost in time and future technical debt.


 This position is a full\-time role reporting to the cofounders at Wanderlog.
   

  

**What You Might Work On**
* New, user\-friendly hotel booking interfaces that make finding a place to stay easier.
* AI\-powered tools that read articles and watch videos for you and summarize the places they mention.
* Improvements to our React Native mobile app so that it runs faster on slower Android phones.
* A Chrome extension to let travelers quickly compare possible places to visit, airfares, and hotels.
* Better invite and collaboration tools to encourage people using Wanderlog to get more friends to join them.
* A better profile page that lets travelers on Wanderlog show off where they’ve been, see how many people they’ve helped, and follow other friends and their trips.


**You May Be a Good Fit If You**
* Are a Javascript developer comfortable with React and/or React Native.
* Are a product person: you’ve built products end\-to\-end before, and really care about the people who use them.
* Are comfortable with picking up various technologies for the task at hand. We quickly evaluate libraries and tools that could help our product, and variously use Redis, Elasticsearch, and Python as needed too.
* Are entrepreneurial: excited about joining a small, high\-growth team and talking to users, doing product and design, and wearing a variety of hats.
* Love travel and believe in it as a positive force personally and for the world.


 What’s it like to work here?
   

  

 We’re an engineering and product\-heavy team. Travel’s something everyone does, and we love using the tools we build. A typical week’s work involves talking to users, prioritizing tasks in Sheets, designing on Figma, and building and shipping them continuously.
   

  

 Our values include putting travelers first, owning the product end\-to\-end, treating teammates with respect, and moving fast by being smart about what we build and how we build it.
   

  

 We believe in work fitting in with your life. We love travel and believe it rejuvenates us and makes us better people, and have twice annual travel offsites where the goal is to enjoy visiting a new place and collaborate more closely with the team in person.
   

  

 Our hiring process
   

  

 We’ll first have you do 2 short rounds of asynchronous programming challenges, including one with a virtual interviewer. After that, we’ll have a coding interview where you work on a quick program on your laptop in your preferred language with one of the founders, followed by a half\-day final\-round virtual onsite via video call.
   

  

 Founders
   

  

 Peter Xu and Harry Yu are twin brothers. Peter shuttled between Los Angeles, Houston, New York, Tokyo, and Hong Kong as a consultant at McKinsey before settling down at Stripe as a full\-stack engineer, where he worked closely with support teams to build tools that made support agents’ work more productive.
   

  

 Harry worked at Google as a product manager on Hotel Search, Chrome, and finally Google Assistant for the past three, where he was one of the early PMs on the team.
   

  

 Before building Wanderlog, they had built Coursetable (featured in the New York Times) and travel sites All the Flight Deals (a flight deals aggregator) and BookWithMatrix (a power\-traveler flight search tool). The founders are now glad to have been working on Wanderlog for 6 years, and are excited to make travelers’ lives easier!","Travel Arrangements","https://www.linkedin.com/company/wanderlog","https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGJK1FPm3isRQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1668459653307/wanderlog_logo?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4f2zeRi61QD-8vO144WkhRL4JKbVk-XsjjI320Zh_9E","","","","","","['python', 'java', 'javascript', 'typescript', 'react', 'node.js', 'rest']","","","","","","7","python, java, javascript, typescript, react, node.js, rest"

* You have experience in infrastructure. You’re comfortable spinning up new cloud resources, from microservices to queues, caches, and DB clusters, you’re familiar with best practices when it comes to assembling the components of your system designs.
* You have experience with observability tooling. You’ve used logging, profilers, distributed tracing, etc. to track down tricky bugs or performance issues in production systems.
* You have strong product intuition. You have to ability think broadly and cross\-functionally around how your technical decisions will impact the end\-user product experience both in terms of how existing features work as well as what new functionality could be unlocked.
* You are an empathetic communicator. You express nuanced ideas clearly at different levels of abstraction for different audiences. In disagreements, you prioritize curiosity over confrontation, making sure everyone feels heard and understood. You avoid tying your ego to the systems you’ve built or are trying to build.
* You’re familiar with our current tech stack or can learn unfamiliar technologies quickly. Our current tech stack is:

 ***This internship will take place from Jan 26 \- Apr 17 and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.***
**About The Role**
 Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means a million people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion. This is where you come in.
   

  

 During your 12\-week internship, you will be paired with a mentor that will help guide you as you work closely with our team to build and ship impactful projects. These projects will drive valuable impact to our customers and engineers. From product engineering, mobile, to infrastructure and security, we have opportunities available on different teams.

**What You'll Achieve**

* Design \& enhance the Notion platform with new capabilities, as and when the need arises.
* Design, develop, and own new product functionality and/or infrastructure leveraging modern frameworks and tooling.
* Develop, fix and debug software for web services, databases, applications, tools, networks.


**Qualifications**
* Pursuing a bachelor's or master’s degree in computer science, engineering, or another related field. Must graduate before December 2026\.
* Previous internship experience.
* Working towards a proficiency of one or more programming languages such as Typescript, Node.js, Go, Python, Java, Swift, Rust, or Kotlin.
* You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering problems as much as solving them.
* You are able to problem\-solve and adapt to changing priorities in a fast\-paced, dynamic environment.
* This internship will take place from Jan \- Apr and you will need to be able to work out of our NY or SF office during this time.


**Skills You’ll Need To Bring**

* For a backend internship: You have a passion for learning how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Familiarity with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL is a plus.
* For a frontend internship: You have a passion for learning technologies (CSS, Javascript, \& React) and best practices in front\-end architecture, including performance, accessibility and usability.
* Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
* Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
* Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross\-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.


**Nice To Haves**
* You have expertise with specific technologies that are part of our stack, including Typescript, React, Electron, Node.js, AWS, and Postgres.
* You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.
* You have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.

* For a android internship: You have a passion for Android development and are excited to work on large scale challenges with cutting\-edge technology.
* Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.
* Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
* Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.
* Team player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross\-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.
