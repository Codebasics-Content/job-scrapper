It’s a chance to build something category-defining with people who care deeply about doing it right.

We’re building a high-performing, culture at our San Francisco HQ, where the team collaborates shoulder-to-shoulder.

Hi, we're The Browser Company 👋 and we're building a better way to use the internet.

Browsers are unique in that they are one of the only pieces of software that you share with your parents as well as your kids. Which makes sense, they're our doorway to the most important things — through them we socialize with loved ones, work on our passion projects, and explore our curiosities. But on their own, they don’t actually do a whole lot, they’re kind of just there. They don’t help us organize our messy lives or make it easier to compose our ideas. We believe that the browser could do so much more — it can empower and support the amazing things we do on the internet. That’s why we’re building one: a browser that can help us grow, create, and stay curious.

To accomplish this lofty task, we’re building a diverse team of people from different backgrounds and experiences. This isn’t optional, it’s crucial to our mission, as we need a wide range of perspectives to challenge our assumptions and shape our browser through a bold, creative lens. With that in mind, we especially encourage women, people of color, and others from historically marginalized groups to apply.

About The Role

As our founding ML Engineering Manager at the Browser Company, you’ll build our strategy and define how we incorporate ML to advance Dia’s product vision. The browser holds most of the context about your workday, from memory of the tasks you’re trying to accomplish to access to all of your web apps. We use ML and AI to turn that context into high‑utility experiences that feel personal and improve over time, grounded in capabilities like computer‑use, memory, and web‑app integrations.

Dia’s Assistant doesn’t just execute actions, it also suggests and recommend tasks, and learns which choices drive real outcomes. We leverage modern training techniques such as SFT, RL, and GEPA to optimize these experiences while protecting privacy. To move fast and learn continuously, we’re building a first‑class ML developer environment: curated data pipelines, tight experiment loops, offline/online evals with telemetry, and one‑click deploys with strong observability.

Our Management Philosophy

Engineering Managers at Browser Company are hands-on technical leaders who build high-performing and psychologically-safe teams with a diverse group of individuals. You’ll work closely with your team to make product decisions, prioritize work, ship features, and promote an engineering culture of knowledge sharing and mentorship. Engineering Managers follow the same onboarding pathway as an IC engineer to learn our product data, and build processes, then ramp into leadership.

Overall you will...


Define and build our ML strategy, sequencing bets that improve Dia’s assistant and measurable user outcomes. You’ll stay ahead of the latest AI advancements and translate them into strategic opportunities for Dia’s roadmap.
Prototype, architect, and ship LLM‑powered features; establish techniques to train models that improve over time and personalize experiences, partnering with Design and Product Engineering to balance quality, speed, and scale for real‑world use.
Audit and evolve the ML stack and infrastructure - spanning Swift for on-device inference and Python for models and tooling - to support both encoder and decoder model families across client and server. Over time, scale the system using fine-tuned open-source LLMs.
Partner on privacy and security by working with Security and Infra on data stewardship, deployment strategies, and responsible scaling.
Establish ML Developer Experience by building tooling and workflows for high quality data curation, experimentation (fine-tuning, RL, prompting), evals, and continuous training to improve the models that power Dia.
Support and build a talented team of machine learning engineers, helping them grow both technically and with a product mindset through fast iteration cycles. You’ll play a key role in contributing across the engineering org as we scale—owning processes, recruiting, and onboarding—and proactively improve architecture and practices to enhance performance, stability, and maintainability.


Technical Projects You’ll Shape With Us…


Browser context engine: learn a unified embedding space that fuses app integrations, enterprise connectors, and on-device signals to enable low-latency retrieval, routing, and personalization
Personalize the command bar: develop ranking, intent understanding, and context-aware suggestions; fine-tune and evaluate models to measurably boost relevance and engagement
Evolve our data flywheel by defining how we instrument product signals, design collection/storage pipelines, create labeling/evaluation loops, and continuously retrain to improve feature quality and personalization


Qualifications


6+ years of experience training, optimizing, and productionizing modern ML models, especially ones that run in a real-world product environment (bonus if you’ve worked closely with transfor

A catalyst for action with a relentless drive for execution. We need a doer who thrives on speed and velocity, takes absolute ownership of outcomes, and is energized by a fast-paced environment
Strong product instincts and user empathy — you think beyond models and love solving real problems
Able to clearly communicate business context and product priorities to engineers — helping them build the right things, not just functional code
Deep experience building AI/ML systems, ideally with LLMs in production
Familiarity with the modern AI/LLM ecosystem
Hands-on knowledge of prompt engineering, vector databases, orchestration tools, and model evaluation pipelines
Clear communicator, comfortable leading discussions and making decisions
Previous startup or fast-paced environment experience is a plus

Who are we?

Hi! 👋 We are Ravelin! We're a fraud detection company using advanced machine learning and network analysis technology to solve big problems. Our goal is to make online transactions safer and help our clients feel confident serving their customers.

And we have fun in the meantime! We are a friendly bunch and pride ourselves in having a strong culture and adhering to our values of empathy, ambition, unity and integrity. We really value work/life balance and we embrace a flat hierarchy structure company-wide. Join us and you'll learn fast about cutting-edge tech and work with some of the brightest and nicest people around - check out our Glassdoor reviews.

If this sounds like your cup of tea, we would love to hear from you! For more information check out our blog to see if you would like to help us prevent crime and protect the world's biggest online businesses.

The Team

You will be joining the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low - and clients happy - by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google's Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.

Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it's down to the Detection team to investigate why.

The Detection team is core to Ravelin's success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.

The Role

We are currently looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.

Evaluating fraud models is hard; often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You'll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you're investigating the veracity of the model itself.

We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud: our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.

The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job - and understand why both are important.

Responsibilities


Build out our model evaluation and training infrastructure
Develop and deploy new models to detect fraud whilst maintaining SLAs
Write new features in our production infrastructure
Research new techniques to disrupt fraudulent behaviour
Investigate model performance issues (using your experience of debugging models)


Requirements


Around 1 year's Experience building and deploying ML models using the Python data stack (numpy, pandas, sklearn)

Allica Relationship Managers support their customers through the provision of appropriate Allica Bank products including Business Current Accounts, Savings Accounts, Commercial Loans, Asset Finance and Working Capital Facilities.




All Relationship Manager roles at Allica Bank carry a requirement for new business acquisition as we continue to build the bank. Where portfolios are held, they are built to allow capacity to do this. Relationship Managers will bring, and continue to build, a strong network of trusted SME advisors such as accountants, solicitors, business organisations and others (but not commercial finance brokers – these are looked after by our dedicated broker team). We expect our Relationship Managers to be recognised as valued partners and experts in business finance by their clients and in the communities they serve.

Being a positive contributor to Allica’s culture, and always demonstrating the bank’s values
Complying with all mandatory policies, and adherence to operational procedures to maintain internal controls.




Personal Attributes & Experience

Our mission

Imagine yourself building the next breakthrough AI/Machine-Learning technology, enabling "AI for everyone" at the start of the company's explosive growth.

Super.AI is used by global enterprises across all industries, from banks, logistics, and insurance companies to Testing, Inspection, and certification (TIC) or retail companies. Super.AI has created the world’s most advanced AI automation platform to extract data from any document with guaranteed quality. We enable companies to leverage the latest AI models, including. LLMs, and super.AI Data Processing Crowd for human-in-the-loop (HITL) review to automate business processes end-to-end with guaranteed results.

Your profile

What you'll do:


Measure and ensure the high-quality output of AI workloads for our enterprise customers.
Deploy and manage production workloads for a global customer base.
Write, rewrite, and extend Python code, and deploy it to containers (e.g., Docker).
Conduct local testing using tools like Jupyter Notebook.

Perform prompt engineering for customer use cases.
Fine-tune and deploy Large Language Models (LLMs).
Develop software that scales to meet the demands of high-load customer workloads.


What we are looking for:


Smart, humble, hardworking, and collaborative
By smart we don't necessarily mean high IQ (although a huge plus), but an affinity toward learning. We want to automate as much as possible so we can focus on the few things that require human intelligence and creativity.
By humble we don't mean submissive or unambitious, we mean it in the same way Roger Federer is humble.
By hardworking, we don't mean long hours (be with your family). What we mean is while you're here you're doing the best work of your life. It means being disciplined, professional, focused, gritty, resilient, and resourceful.
By collaborative, we don't mean submissive or deferential, it means taking leadership from everywhere. "I'm taking responsibility to fix this system", if there's a lack of trust "I'm going to address it" if goals are unclear "I'm going to deal with it", it's about being a meritocracy
All four of the above are required. We all know people missing one of these and it's not nice to work with them (e.g. someone who is smart and hardworking but not humble and collaborative).
Paradoxical
The people we like the most are smart but humble
Wants to win no matter what, but will not cross lines of integrity to get there
Strong beliefs weakly held, etc.

Your Experience:


3-5 years of professional experience in software development.
Proven ability to work backwards from customer needs to deliver AI-based features that meet those needs.
Ability to organize and prioritize competing workloads.
Familiarity with distributed systems and cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
Solid understanding of machine learning principles.
Experience with container frameworks such as Docker or Kubernetes.
Proficiency in using REST APIs.


If this resonates with you, it would be amazing to get to know each other.

Why us?

At super.AI our mission is to make AI accessible to all and use AI to enrich the human experience and make the world a better place. We are a group of smart, creative people who have come together from MIT, Microsoft Research, AWS, Google, and Apple to work toward that mission. As a first step towards that goal, we have built an AI platform to help businesses make sense of unstructured data. Our culture is collaborative and fun that puts customers first.

About Us


We believe AI is going to be the most impactful technology ever invented. It may be the last technology we ever needed to invent as humans. We don’t want it to be in the hands of the few, but the hands of the many. Our technology promises to transform the way AI is created and consumed to make this vision possible.
We are searching for the best-of-the-best to build a massive company, but at the same time a company where people are happy with their lives, feel healthy, passionate and satisfied.
We're at an inflection point, so you will have the opportunity to shape things and see the company grow
Although super.AI is young, this is not our first rodeo: our CEO previously founded a few hundred person company, and between us we've held senior positions at Google, Amazon, Adobe, Microsoft, Docusign and others

About Lunar




Lunar is a young and global minded venture capital firm that partners with highly technical founders from the very beginning - often before a company exists. We back scientists and engineers building real technology, not just chasing trends. We’ve been early to emerging technologies such as AI, data infrastructure, biotech, and aerospace, creating an aggregate enterprise value exceeding $1.5B. Our current early bets are in data infrastructure, tech bio, autonomy, and aerospace, among others. 

Our team comes from technical and operational backgrounds. We pride ourselves in diving in and asking deep questions — and in working closely with founders from day zero.

Working at Lunar means working closely to the next wave of emergent ideas and themes, and having a tangible role in helping the most ambitious founders succeed on a global stage.

About the Role




We’re looking for an Automation AI Engineer to pioneer how venture capital uses AI and automation. 

This isn’t traditional desk research- it’s about building and running the systems that power sourcing, analysis, and internal efficiency. You’ll design AI-assisted workflows, automate repetitive processes, and experiment with tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and n8n to make Lunar’s sourcing and intelligence operations faster, smarter, and more scalable.

We’re looking for a builder- someone already exploring how to make work smarter with AI and automation. You’ll have the autonomy to shape your work, experiment, and continuously improve how we operate.

You’ll have the autonomy to shape your work, experiment freely, break things and rebuild them smarter.




What You’ll Do




Design and implement automation workflows across sourcing, CRM, and reporting.
Integrate and optimize tools like n8n, Make, Zapier, Airtable, and HubSpot.
Use AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) to accelerate research, data extraction, and insight generation.
Build lightweight scripts, agents, or automations (no formal coding background needed).
Continuously identify opportunities to replace manual work with smart systems.
Experiment with new AI features and integrations to push our processes forward.
Maintain clean, structured data pipelines across CRMs and internal tools.
Collaborate directly with partners to design experiments, dashboards, and alerts.




What we’re looking for




3+ years of hands-on experience in automation, data operations, or growth.
Experience with automation platforms (n8n, Make, Zapier, HubSpot workflows).
Proficiency with data and productivity tools (Google Sheets, Airtable, Notion, CRMs).
Fluent with AI tools. You use tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Cursor to research, brainstorm, and build smarter workflows.
You love fixing what’s broken. You spot inefficiencies fast and enjoy building clever, automated systems that make life easier for everyone.
You’re self-driven and adaptable. You take ownership, move fast, and stay calm when things change (which they often do).
You communicate with energy and clarity. You enjoy sharing ideas, showing your work, and collaborating with people who love building cool things together.
You make things happen. You’d rather ship and learn than wait for perfect — progress excites you more than polish.




Nice to Have




Experience in venture capital, tech startups, or data-driven investment research.
Familiarity with APIs, basic scripting, or AI-agent integrations.
Experience connecting data sources or building light data pipelines.
Curiosity for deep tech, software infrastructure, or AI ecosystems.
“Builder” mindset — enjoys experimenting, testing, and improving workflows.
Prior experience as a growth operator, technical SDR, or automation lead.




Why Lunar




At Lunar, we move fast, think technically, and experiment constantly. You’ll work with partners who understand the power of automation - not just as an efficiency tool, but as a creative advantage. You’ll have real ownership, the freedom to build, and the opportunity to redefine how venture capital works in the AI age.

Benefits



Competitive Compensation & Meaningful Equity: We value talent and back it with fair, founder-level alignment. You’ll own a real stake in the company’s future.


High-Impact, High-Ownership Role: You won’t be a cog in the machine. You’ll own initiatives end-to-end and help shape the core of our AI stack and company direction.


Work Directly with the CEO & Founding Team: Collaborate daily with the CEO and technical leadership to drive product, strategy, and long-term vision.


Build What Doesn’t Exist (Yet): We’re working on first-principle AI infrastructure that doesn’t exist elsewhere. If you’re here to do original, meaningful work — this is it.


Zero Bureaucracy, Maximum Autonomy: We move fast, stay lean, and keep decision-making close to the builders. Your input drives the roadmap.


Flexible, But In-Person Matters: We’re remote-first, but we believe in the power of face-to-face time. We hold monthly gatherings/hackathons in SF and Europe, to stay aligned and build real momentum together. Results still matter more than hours — but we show up when it counts.





Our Hiring Process




We move fast, stay transparent, and focus on real collaboration. Here’s what the process looks like:





Intro Call – A quick chat to align on expectations, interests, and team fit.


Technical Deep Dive – A focused conversation with our Engineering Manager to explore your technical thinking and past work.


CEO Interview – A strategic discussion around vision, mindset, and long-term alignment.


Reference Collection – We’ll speak with a few people you’ve worked closely with.


Paid Trial (~5 Days) – A short, real-world engagement so we can see how we work together — happening in parallel with offer and terms discussion.





Please note:





As a startup, you can expect a fast-paced environment where extreme ownership is required.

Join us as a Data Scientist (m/f/d) in our Verification & Validation team and help shape the future of autonomous mobility!

As the Verification & Validation team, we ensure that autonomous driving systems are safe, reliable, and ready for the road. We bridge simulation, testing, and real-world validation through data-driven insights and visual models. Our mission is to answer the critical question: "Is the system ready to deploy?"

We're a diverse group with backgrounds in data science, machine learning, statistics, and automotive testing. We value collaboration, curiosity, and the drive to solve complex problems that directly impact road safety.

What you will do

Be a data scientist!


Develop Computer Vision and statistical models for vehicle behavior validation, scenario analysis, and test coverage assessment.
Build analytics frameworks to compute V&V-specific KPIs (test coverage, scenario diversity, edge case identification, performance benchmarks).
Create models for anomaly detection, scenario classification, and validation of digital twins (vehicle models, sensor models, 3D environments).
Design and implement data pipelines to process large-scale test data from simulation (SiL, HiL) and vehicle testing.
You build it, you run it. With the help of AI Engineers and support from platform teams, you take full ownership over your model code from testing to maintenance and deployment.
Analyze multi-modal sensor data (camera, lidar, radar, GPS) and system logs to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.


Be an analyst!


Validate simulation fidelity against real-world vehicle data through statistical analysis.
Develop dashboards and visualizations that communicate complex test results to stakeholders.
Support root cause analysis for test failures and system anomalies.
Build metrics to assess scenario realism and representativeness across testing platforms.
Contribute to homologation and regulatory compliance through data analysis and reporting.


Be a team player!


Collaborate closely with V&V engineers, function developers, and simulation teams to translate requirements into analytical solutions.
Support cross-functional teams with data-driven insights for test strategy optimization.
Share knowledge through documentation, presentations, and pair programming sessions.
Contribute to continuous improvement of V&V processes and methodologies.


What will help you to fulfill your role


You have a background in data science, machine learning, statistics, or a related technical field.
You're proficient in Python and SQL, and comfortable building data pipelines and analysis scripts. Experience with statistical modeling (regression, classification, clustering, anomaly detection) and time-series analysis is essential.
Previous experience with professional software engineering practices, like version control (git), unit testing, and an understanding of the python package ecosystem.
You have experience with data visualization tools (e.g., Apache Superset, Tableau, or custom solutions) and know how to tell compelling stories with data.
You're familiar with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and understand how to build scalable analytics solutions. Bonus points if you've worked with data warehouses like Redshift or Snowflake.
You have a collaborative mindset and can translate complex analytics into actionable insights for diverse stakeholders—from engineers to decision-makers.
You're curious and analytical, with an investigative approach to problem-solving. You don't just find patterns—you understand what they mean and why they matter.


Nice to have:


Understanding of autonomous driving systems, V&V processes, or automotive KPIs (MTBI, roadmanship).
Experience with simulation platforms (VTD, Unity, Unreal, Carla) or automotive data formats (mcap, mf4, ROS bags).
Knowledge of safety standards (ISO 26262, ASPICE) or EU regulations for autonomous vehicles.
Familiarity with ML deployment (MLOps) and workflow orchestration (Apache Airflow).
Experience with automotive-specific visualization tools (Lichtblick, rerun).
You're comfortable working in a multi-national team with occasional travel for meetings (e.g., PI Planning, ~1x/month). You value diverse perspectives and enjoy working in a hybrid environment where learning and experimentation are encouraged.
Most importantly, you're excited about shaping the future of autonomous driving through data science.


We welcome applicants from diverse backgrounds — even if you don't meet every requirement. If you're excited about the role and MOIA's mission, we'd love to hear from you!

Join us as an AI Engineer (m/f/d) in our Verification & Validation team and help shape the future of autonomous mobility!

As the Verification & Validation team, we ensure that autonomous driving systems are safe, reliable, and ready for the road. We bridge simulation, testing, and real-world validation through AI-driven solutions and machine learning models. Our mission is to assess system performance, simulation fidelity, and data quality at scale.

We're a diverse group with backgrounds in machine learning, AI research, computer vision, and autonomous systems. We value innovation, collaboration, and the drive to push the boundaries of what's possible in autonomous vehicle validation.

What you will do

Be an AI engineer!


Design, validate, and deploy AI-driven solutions for assessing autonomous driving systems, including scenario detection, anomaly detection, roadmanship scoring, and predictive analytics.
Build scalable ML/AI solutions for simulation validation, perception analysis, behavior modeling, and scene understanding.
Develop models for digital twin generation (vehicle models, 3D environments, sensor models) to support high-fidelity testing.
Integrate ML models into cloud-based analytics pipelines (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Bedrock) for automated evaluation and monitoring.
Work with multi-modal sensor data (camera, lidar, radar, GPS) to build robust models that generalize across diverse scenarios.


Be a researcher!


Experiment with cutting-edge AI techniques (deep learning, transformer models, computer vision, GenAI) to solve novel validation challenges.
Assess simulation fidelity and realism through AI-driven analysis of synthetic vs. real-world data.
Develop metrics and methods to evaluate model performance, robustness, and scenario coverage.
Contribute to internal research and share findings through documentation, presentations, and knowledge-sharing sessions.


Be a team player!


Collaborate closely with V&V engineers, data scientists, and simulation teams to understand requirements and deliver AI solutions.
Support cross-functional teams in integrating AI models into production systems and validation workflows.
Mentor team members on ML best practices, model development, and deployment strategies.
Contribute to continuous improvement of AI/ML infrastructure and methodologies.


What will help you to fulfill your role


You have a strong background in machine learning, AI, or computer science, with hands-on experience building and deploying ML models.
You're proficient in Python and ML frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Experience with deep learning, computer vision, and transformer models is highly valued.
You have experience with MLOps practices—model training, deployment, monitoring, and CI/CD for ML systems. Familiarity with cloud platforms (AWS SageMaker, Bedrock, or similar) is a plus.
You understand the full ML lifecycle from problem formulation and data preparation to model evaluation and deployment. You know how to build scalable, production-ready AI solutions.
You have a collaborative and innovative mindset, comfortable working with stakeholders to translate business problems into ML solutions.
You're curious and driven, excited about exploring new AI techniques and applying them to real-world challenges in autonomous driving.


Nice to have:


Understanding of autonomous driving systems, V&V processes, or safety-critical AI applications.
Experience with simulation platforms (Unity, Unreal, Carla, VTD) or digital twin development.
Knowledge of safety standards (ISO 26262, ASPICE) or EU regulations for autonomous vehicles.
Experience with feature engineering from multi-modal sensor data (camera, lidar, radar).
Familiarity with GenAI, federated learning, or multi-agent systems.
Background in computer vision, scene understanding, or perception systems.
You're comfortable working in a multi-national team with occasional travel for meetings (e.g., PI Planning, ~1x/month). You value diverse perspectives and enjoy working in a hybrid environment where experimentation and learning are encouraged.
Most importantly, you're excited about shaping the AI backbone of autonomous vehicle validation.

About Sifflet

We are building the world’s best data observability platform to help companies excel at data-driven decision making.

Today, half of a data team’s time is spent troubleshooting data quality issues. Sifflet is putting an end to that. Our solution allows data engineers and data consumers to visualize how data flows between their services, define data quality checks, and quickly find the root cause of any data anomaly.

About The Job

The monitoring team implements the foundational capabilities of Sifflet: detecting data quality issues across a wide range of data warehouses and databases.

Sifflet's monitoring capabilities rely heavily on machine learning (ML) techniques. Most advanced data quality checks are based on time series forecasting models that detect unexpected distribution changes while accounting for seasonality and one-off events. Additionally, ML-based features are present throughout our product, be it for intelligent alert grouping, automated incident description, or automated monitor suggestions.

As a machine learning engineer on the monitoring team, you will:


Build automated data profiling systems that learn normal data patterns and detect deviations.
Deploy time series forecasting models that understand data seasonality and business cycles.
Create intelligent alerting systems that reduce noise through ML-powered incident correlation.
Implement generative AI workflows across the product, such as enabling users to describe their monitoring needs in natural language.
Contribute to product decisions and identify areas where adding ML/AI-based features can solve customer pain points.


As we’re a small team, you will be expected to design, implement, deploy and maintain your projects in production, and integrate them with other services. Thus, this role includes a significant software engineering component.

Some projects you could be working on


Automated monitor recommendations based on data profiling metrics.
Automated root cause analysis of any data quality incident, building upon the many sources of metadata Sifflet collects (table lineage, query history, past monitor failures…).


Our stack


The monitoring engine is built with Python 3 and its large data/ML ecosystem (notably PyTorch).
The web API is written in (modern) Java with Spring Boot 3, the web frontend is a VueJS application written in Typescript. You may occasionally need to make minor changes to this code base.
Infrastructure: Kubernetes (AWS EKS clusters), MySQL (on AWS RDS), Temporal for job orchestration
Plus a few supporting services: Gitlab CI, Prometheus/Loki/Grafana, Sentry…


While not directly part of our stack, expect to gain a lot of knowledge on many products in the modern data ecosystem. The subtleties of BigQuery or Snowflake will soon be very familiar to you.

Are we the company you’re looking for?


We have offices in Paris, but we’re very remote friendly - several team members are fully remote.
We offer competitive salary and company equity.

Contexte du projet

L'insomnie touche près d'un Français sur cinq, mais son évaluation se heurte aux limites des examens cliniques : coûteux, ponctuels et souvent déconnectés du ressenti réel des patients. Le suivi à domicile par des objets connectés représente donc une révolution pour mieux comprendre cette pathologie sur le long terme et en conditions de vie réelle.

La force de l'écosystème Withings réside précisément dans sa capacité à croiser les données physiologiques objectives de nos capteurs (montre ScanWatch et capteur de sommeil Sleep Analyzer) avec les données subjectives issues de l'application. Ce projet vise à développer une compréhension plus fine et plus juste de l'insomnie, pour offrir à nos utilisateurs des outils de santé véritablement personnalisés.

Objectif du stage :

L'objectif principal de ce stage est de concevoir, développer et valider un modèle de Machine Learning capable de distinguer les sujets souffrant d'insomnie des dormeurs sains à base de leurs données objectives.

Pour y parvenir, le ou la stagiaire s'appuiera sur un jeu de données unique et à grande échelle, provenant de nos dispositifs : la montre connectée ScanWatch et le capteur de sommeil Sleep Analyzer. Au total, le ou la stagiaire aura accès aux données issues de centaines de milliers de nuits de sommeil provenant de milliers d'utilisateurs. La labellisation des troubles s'appuie sur des questionnaires validés cliniquement, garantissant une base scientifique solide pour l'entraînement des modèles.

Missions

Ce stage est structuré comme un véritable projet de recherche et développement :

Exploration et prétraitement des données : Prise en main des ensembles de données, exploration et revue de la littérature pour identifier les biomarqueurs les plus prometteurs.

Conception et implémentation du pipeline : Sélection des approches de modélisation (Machine Learning) et des méthodes de validation. Développement d'un pipeline robuste, reproductible et documenté.

Itération et optimisation : Amélioration des performances du modèle en explorant différentes features, architectures et techniques d'apprentissage.

Analyse et synthèse : Analyse fine des performances du modèle, rédaction d'un rapport de stage détaillé et finalisation de la documentation.

Il s'agit d'un projet de recherche exploratoire, dont les résultats, s'ils sont probants, pourront faire l'objet d'une publication scientifique. À plus long terme, l'algorithme développé a pour vocation d'être intégré à l'écosystème Withings pour offrir une nouvelle fonctionnalité innovante à nos milliers d'utilisateurs.

Requirements

Connaissances et compétences souhaitées :


Connaissances théoriques en traitement du signal et en machine learning

About The Forecasting Company

We are on a mission to create the forecasting foundation model to rule them all. Forecasting drives critical decisions worldwide - impacting staffing, supply chain management, finance and more. Our solution provides companies with the models, platform and APIs they need to easily generate the most accurate forecasts possible, helping to significantly reduce waste and enabling smarter, more confident decisions.

Who we’re looking for

The forecasting model is at the heart of our technology. As the second founding MLE, you will build, train and deploy large foundation model architectures: implement and combine ideas from the literature, push the state of the art, and ultimately deploy your model for our customers to use in production. Our goal is for our models to be the best for our customers’ use cases - including for capabilities that do not exist yet in academic models.

You love your craft, have high standards, stay up-to-date with the latest ideas in ML, and know when to make trade-offs to ship. You live and breathe neural networks, and speak PyTorch or Jax. You are used to diving deep in large amounts of data, and you know what you train your models on. Bonus if you have experience building solid ML infrastructure.

You are passionate about your craft, maintain high standards, stay current with the latest tech and know when to make trade-offs to deliver results efficiently. We do not believe great engineers are “jack of all trades”, but rather that they excel at diving deep into complex topics quickly, leveraging a broad range of experiences to solve challenging problems. You are also open to exploring new concepts, technologies, and enjoy quickly throwing prototypes together to kick the tires. You prefer quick feedback loops, rather than aiming for perfection on the first try.

What you’ll be doing


Architect and train time-series foundation models using diverse datasets, integrating multimodal inputs like numerical time series, text, location and image data
Stay up-to-date on the foundation model literature
Design reproducible experiments to verify, compare and combine ideas from the literature.
Build your own data exploration tools to understand (lagged) correlations between different data sources, data sparsity, weather patterns, consumer trends…
Add data sources you find interesting to our train or test datasets.
Deploy models for use in our API and platform - getting into the gritty details if exporting to ONNX requires some custom operation or torch.compile fails
Gather and act on user feedback, iterating on model capabilities to maximize customer satisfaction and impact.
Mentor and guide future team members, helping shape a high-performing science and engineering culture as the team grows.


Requirements

Must have


You have extensive ML engineering and science experience.
You have worked on training large foundation models.
You are intimately familiar with Python, PyTorch or Jax.
Strong drive and ambition - you really care about having an impact on the product, and revenue.
You go deep. You enjoy understanding all the details, and you don’t make assumptions without checking them.


Nice to have


You are intimately familiar with at least one low-level language such as CUDA, Rust or C++.
You’ve worked extensively with time series data and systems delivering real-time data streams.
You have started projects from scratch. You might have led a project, been a founder previously, or built an impressive side project with real users.
You have built RAG-ready models.


Why join The Forecasting Company?


Be part of an elite, diverse and fun team. We celebrate having people with different backgrounds who are the best at what they do. We especially enjoy working with cracked people with nonlinear paths. Our CTO was a theater consultant in another life. 🎭We already hail from 6 nationalities with only 5 people. Come be our 7th!
Make the world more efficient. In business, success is driven by smart decision-making. By providing the most accurate insights as early as possible, we help ensure that more decisions lead to successful outcomes, creating a positive impact worldwide.

Rejoindre Davidson, ce n’est pas seulement intégrer un groupe de 3000 consultants dans 6 pays et 2 continents, c’est intégrer LA société qui a été élue par ses salariés Great Place To Work France et Europe pendant 4 ans mais aussi une des plus grandes B Corp de France, nommée Best of the World dans la catégorie “collaborateurs” en 2022 ! (Les “B Corp” formant une communauté de sociétés qui ont décidé d’être non pas les meilleures du monde mais les meilleures POUR le monde).

Parce que notre développement repose sur des principes forts :


Un profond respect de l’ensemble de nos parties prenantes : consultant(e)s, clients et fournisseurs. Car si le travail “ne fait pas le bonheur”, il peut cependant “faire le malheur”. Nous nous engageons donc à écouter et agir avec honnêteté.
Une égalité des chances dans le traitement de nos candidatures et dans la gestion de carrière de nos salarié(e)s. Nous croyons en un milieu de travail où équité F/H, inclusion et diversité sont la norme.
Une empreinte environnementale minimale, et sociétale maximale. C’est pourquoi, au-delà des missions que vous réaliserez, vous pourrez également contribuer à des projets que Davidson soutient : missions de solidarité internationale (avec Planète Urgence), bénévolat auprès d’associations (chaque Davidsonien(ne) dispose de 3 jours par an pour intervenir à leurs côtés), accompagnement d’étudiant(e)s issus de milieux peu favorisés (avec Article 1), investissement dans des startups développant des solutions innovantes, actions collectives et individuelles pour la réduction de notre impact carbone…
Un Management adhocratique basé sur la mise en œuvre des principes de “l’entreprise horizontale” et du “management tribal”. Sur ce dernier point une précision d’importance : le bien-être au travail est un luxe qu’il faut pouvoir s’offrir en étant une entreprise “solide”. Ceci induit pour les Davidsonien(ne)s d’allier prises d’initiative, engagement et professionnalisme. Car “sans travail, le talent n’est qu’une sale manie”. Et cela nous incite à chercher à recruter des personnes… meilleures que nous…


Nous encourageons les candidatures de personnes en situation de handicap, et nous nous engageons à répondre au mieux à leurs besoins spécifiques.

Contexte

Les récents développements autour des modèles de fondation et de l’intelligence artificielle générative ouvrent de nouvelles perspectives pour le traitement des séries temporelles. Inspirés des approches utilisées pour le langage ou l’image, ces modèles visent à proposer des architectures capables de s’adapter à un large éventail de tâches (prévision, imputation, classification, détection d’anomalies) avec peu ou pas de réentraînement.

Dans le domaine énergétique, la capacité à prévoir consommation et production à différents niveaux géographiques et temporels (local, régional, national) est stratégique pour l’anticipation et l’optimisation du système.

Some weeks will feel chaotic, some problems will feel bigger than your role. That’s the nature of the ride from startup to scale-up: if you need stability and structure, this won’t fit. But if you thrive on ownership, speed, and building from zero, you’ll love it here.

Why join us


Be part of a product-driven team reinventing how legal professionals work.
Join early and shape the foundation of a fast-growing, high-impact startup.
Work in a place where hierarchy doesn’t matter — only the best ideas do.

At Eneco, anyone with a sharp mind and a positive and active mindset can contribute to a more sustainable world.




Create data driven innovations, services, and products for the whole company.




In Eneco’s digital data science team you will set up data-driven solutions together with other business units. This means you can work on a wide variety of topics on the commercial and the operational side of Eneco, as well as the integration between those two. On the commercial side, this can mean advising customers on sustainable investments based on energy use and building characteristics. On the operational side, improving efficiency of district heating or implementing predictive maintenance for wind turbines can be your next subjects. As an integrated energy company, Eneco is also always looking for innovative solutions to integrate supply and demand. In all these projects, adding value both for the customer and for Eneco is key.




Energy companies have large amounts of data available to work with, and Eneco is a leader in this field, for example from our smart thermostat Toon. The big question is: how will you leverage this data? Distributed energy generation and changes in energy demand have upended the conventional market for energy.

Wij zijn Q42.

Q42 bouwt digitale producten die het leven van mensen slimmer, beter en leuker maken.

Al meer dan 20 jaar helpen we bedrijven als Rijksmuseum, BAM, Polestar, HEMA, AVROTROS, Philips Hue, KLM, 9292 en de Efteling met het bedenken en maken van schaalbare producten. Apps, websites, connected devices, AI-toepassingen en meer. Van idee tot lancering.

Tech zit in de kern van alles wat we doen. Onze teams van developers en projectleiders zijn altijd bezig met snel uitproberen, leren en verbeteren. Totdat het product fijn is in gebruik, de business laat groeien én wij er zelf een glimlach van krijgen.

En we hebben een vacature voor ervaren AI-engineers.

Wij zoeken ervaren AI-engineers die een team kunnen leiden om mooie softwareproducten te maken voor eindgebruikers met inzet van AI.

Nieuwe slimme toepassingen

AI biedt allerlei kansen voor nieuwe slimme toepassingen. Wat ons bij Q42 drijft, is de kracht van AI gebruiken om digitale producten te maken die mensen verbazen en eerder niet mogelijk waren. We werken met diverse klanten samen aan uiteenlopende AI-projecten: van korte experimenten tot langlopende projecten.

Voorbeeld: BAM

BAM maakt voor ieder renovatieproject, zoals het verduurzamen van huizenblokken, gedetailleerde 3D-scans met drones. Het omzetten van deze scans naar nauwkeurige metingen hebben we dankzij AI weten te automatiseren en versnellen. Door eerder over precieze informatie te beschikken kan BAM makkelijker werkzaamheden inplannen en uitvoeren.

Voorbeeld: Amsterdam Vitaal en Gezond

De Amsterdamse huisartsen wilden onderzoeken of zij hun cliënten beter konden helpen met de juiste hulp door de inzet van een laagdrempelige digitale buddy. In dit project hebben we een proof-of-concept ontwikkeld van een slimme en betrouwbare AI-assistent die zorgvragen begrijpt en passende hulp kan bieden. Dus niet een eenvoudige chatbot zoals bij een gemiddelde klantenservice, maar een empathische gesprekspartner die ingewikkelde conversaties kan afhandelen.

Teams

Onze projecten voeren we altijd uit met een team. Onze AI-programmeurs werken altijd nauw samen met onze front-enders, back-enders en app-ontwikkelaars. De precieze teamsamenstelling hangt daarbij steeds af van de opdracht. Voor de rol van AI-engineer zijn we op zoek naar developers die zo'n team kunnen leiden.

Van elkaar leren

De ongeveer acht AI-engineers binnen Q42 wisselen veel kennis uit door ervaringen met elkaar en met andere collega’s te delen. Dat gebeurt via Slack, door samen op kantoor in een uitdaging te duiken en tijdens de regelmatige AI-overleggen.

Bouwen van robuuste softwareproducten

De focus van onze AI-engineers is het bouwen van oplossingen. Ze hebben een goed beeld van de bestaande AI-technieken en hoe deze ingezet kunnen worden. Maar onze AI-experts hebben ook hands on ervaring in het ontwikkelen van robuuste softwareproducten (op basis van bijvoorbeeld cloud- en data-engineering) waarin AI ingezet wordt om het leven van de consument makkelijker te maken.

Flexibel en creatief meedenken

In de functie van AI-engineer is het belangrijk dat je flexibel en creatief kan meedenken met de klant over hoe AI in te zetten in hun projecten, en of AI voor hen wel de juiste oplossing is. De verwachting is dat jij de projecten kan dragen en ervoor zorgt dat het project goed wordt opgeleverd.

Wat je gaat doen

Wanneer je bij Q42 aan de slag gaat als softwaredeveloper met AI-specialisatie, krijg je de verantwoordelijkheid voor een deel van de volgende taken.


Je ontwikkelt solide software en zet de benodigde infrastructuur op in een cloud-omgeving.
Je implementeert AI-as-a-Service (zoals OpenAI’s LLM) in projecten: je kunt inschatten wanneer deze services een goede optie zijn, en wat de eventuele beperkingen zijn.
Je helpt onze klanten in het scherp krijgen van hun vraag, en het bepalen of de inzet van AI voor hen een goede oplossing is.
Je kent pre-trained modellen en beschikbare datasets en bent in staat deze in te zetten als bestaande AI-services tekortschieten voor de specifieke use case.
Je valideert, deployet, monitort en onderhoudt de gebouwde modellen: je zorgt ervoor dat deze op schaal kunnen worden gebruikt.
Je snapt de beperkingen van een model, en hoe deze ondervangen kunnen worden in de UX van het product.


Weet je genoeg en wil je direct solliciteren? Laat hier je gegevens achter en we nemen snel contact met je op. Maar doorlezen mag natuurlijk ook.

Past Q42 bij jou?

Wil je weten of Q - zoals we Q42 meestal noemen - bij jou past? We kunnen je alvast vertellen, wat wij te bieden hebben en waar wij van houden. Dan kun jij inschatten of er voldoende overlap is voor een gesprek.


We bieden een all-in salaris tot 6.500 euro per maand, afhankelijk van jouw ervaring. Dat is inclusief een maximale pensioenregeling, vakantiegeld en internetvergoeding. (Hier lees je hoe we salaris, zelfbeoordeling en persoonlijke ontwikkeling aan elkaar koppelen.)

Als RPA‑Developer bij ilionx Hyperautomation bouw je oplossingen die er écht toe doen. Je werkt aan trajecten met maatschappelijke impact voor zorg, overheid en bedrijfsleven – en coacht collega’s in een omgeving waar jouw input welkom is.




Jouw rol als RPA Developer

Je ontwikkelt en optimaliseert hoogwaardige RPA-automatiseringen (UiPath, Blue Prism, Power Automate), én bouwt aan de toekomst met technologieën als AI en BPM. Als senior denk je strategisch mee over inzet van tools zoals ChatGPT of Microsoft Power Automate bij onze klanten. Hier denk je samen met collega’s over na in onze AI & Agentic werkgroep. Naast coderen begeleid je medior/junior collega's, doe je kennisdeling via DevWeekly en HyperTalks, én ontvang je innovatieupdates rechtstreeks van UiPath.




Je werkt projectmatig bij klanten, maar hebt alle ruimte om initiatieven op te pakken: van Blue Prism tot vernieuwende AI-strategieën. Zo help je klanten slimmer te worden met automation én help je ilionx mee vormgeven aan onze Hyperautomation-visie.




Wat bieden wij jou:

Een salaris van tussen de €3.000,- en €5.500,- o.b.v. 40 uur, afhankelijk van jouw achtergrond en ervaring
Een omgeving waarin het hybride werken compleet omarmd wordt
Duik in moderne projecten en opdrachten die jouw expertise en creativiteit uitdagen
Werken in een team waar jouw ideeën en initiatieven worden gewaardeerd en gestimuleerd
Technische trainingen op maat met certificaten die jouw expertise onderstrepen
Of je je verder wilt verdiepen in RPA of wilt switchen naar een andere specialisatie binnen ilionx: we denken graag met je mee.
Samenwerking met ervaren collega’s in data, cloud en security




Wat vragen wij van jou:

Vasthoudendheid bij het omzetten van vragen naar werkende oplossingen
Je bent klant- en resultaatgericht
Coachende vaardigheden – je helpt collega’s groeien via werkgroepen, workshops en code-review sessies
Een pioniersmentaliteit: je bent nieuwsgierig, neemt initiatief en zoekt actief naar nieuwe manieren om klanten slimmer te maken




Verder heb je:

Minimaal 2 jaar ervaring in programmeren en affiniteit met automatisering
Ervaring met UiPath RPA Software en een sterke codeerachtergrond in C# en/of .NET
Sterke communicatieve en analytische vaardigheden.

Bovenstaande criteria zijn een indicatie van het profiel dat we zoeken. We beseffen dat elk individu een unieke set aan vaardigheden, expertise, skills en denkwijzen met zich meebrengt. Tegelijkertijd blijkt uit onderzoek dat sommigen pas solliciteren als er een 100% match is. Hierbij nodigen we je uit om te solliciteren als je je herkent in het profiel, óók als je niet aan alle eisen voldoet!




Het team

Je werkt nauw samen met een team van zo’n 20 analisten en developers, een jong en gedreven team dat samenwerking en kennisdeling hoog in het vaandel heeft. Bij ilionx Hyperautomation kom je terecht in een hechte omgeving met circa 170 collega’s, waarin continu leren en groeien centraal staat. Naast uitdagende projecten bieden we ook sociale activiteiten aan, zoals gezamenlijke lunches en teamuitjes, zodat je in een ontspannen sfeer kunt verbinden met collega’s en werken echt leuk wordt!

Ons team werkt vol enthousiasme aan diverse toonaangevende projecten voor klanten binnen de zorg, overheid, en het bedrijfsleven. Ben je benieuwd naar de impact die wij realiseren? Lees hier meer over onze samenwerking met onder andere AZ Delta, Frankfort Koning, Bergman Clinics, Gemeente Tilburg, Van Ameyde, Belastingdienst, Stam Groep, en Kwadrantgroep. Zo krijg je direct een inkijkje in ons werk en zie je de waarde die wij creëren voor onze klanten. Klaar om zelf mee te bouwen aan deze inspirerende projecten? Dan maken we graag kennis met je!




Samen zorgen we ervoor dat ilionx een positieve werkomgeving blijft waar jij en je collega’s met plezier werken en successen boeken. Maak jij samen met ons impact door slimme RPA-oplossingen? Dan willen we graag kennismaken!
Ben jij een ervaren Data Engineer met een passie voor het creëren van inzichten en oplossingen op het gebied van publieke veiligheid en gezondheid? Zoek je een uitdagende rol waarin je jouw expertise in Microsoft Azure, SQL Server, (Rest) API, Power BI, Python en R kunt inzetten? Dan nodigen we je graag uit om ons dynamische team bij Veiligheids- en Gezondheidsregio Gelderland-Midden (VGGM) te komen versterken! Veiligheids- en Gezondheidsregio Gelderland-Midden (VGGM) is een boeiende organisatie waar de hulpverlening voor Gelderland Midden samen komt. We blussen branden, reanimeren, vaccineren, voorkomen incidenten en doen nog veel meer voor onze inwoners.

Wat ga je voor ons doen?

Als Data Engineer bij VGGM ben je verantwoordelijk voor het ontwerpen, ontwikkelen en onderhouden van geavanceerde data- en informatieproducten die gericht zijn op het vergroten van het datagedreven en informatiegestuurd werken binnen VGGM. Hierdoor heb je direct impact op publieke veiligheid en gezondheid. Je werkt nauw samen met interne belanghebbenden om de behoeften te begrijpen en vertaalt deze naar technische oplossingen.

Daarnaast schakel je natuurlijk actief met het Data Intelligence team, dat bestaat uit een Product Owner, drie Data Engineers en een technisch applicatiebeheerder. De interne belanghebbenden zijn de data analisten binnen de andere afdelingen, die ook de informatieproducten maken voor hun eigen afdelingen. Binnen de afdeling Bedrijfsvoering maken we zowel de dataproducten, evenals de bijbehorende dashboards en rapportages. De primaire focus ligt op de back-end, waarbij de front-end ook zeker van belang is om mee te nemen in je werkzaamheden.

Er wordt gewerkt door middel van de Agile/Scrum methodiek. Momenteel zijn er drie data platformen in gebruik: het on-premises SQL Server datawarehouse, het externe gehoste Geo platform en het Azure Cloud data platform. Het DWH wordt nu overgezet naar de Azure Cloud en daarmee wordt het on-premise deel uitgefaseerd. Het Geo platform wordt (grotendeels) naar de Azure Cloud overgezet – hiervoor loopt nog een pilot om dit concreet te definiëren.

Je werkt nauw samen met het Data Intelligence Team om deze data platformen te migreren en naar een hoger volwassenheidsniveau te trekken. Denk hierbij ook aan het opzetten van een logisch en technisch gegevensmodel, samen met de business analisten.

Wat je hiervoor doet:


Ontwerpen, en ontwikkelen en implementeren van data- en informatieproducten op het te ontwikkelen Microsoft Azure-platform.
Creëren van ETL-processen met behulp van Azure Synapse/Data Factory, (Azure) SQL.
Integreren van gegevens van verschillende bronnen via (Rest) API's en andere methoden.
Ontwikkelen van interactieve dashboards en rapporten met behulp van Power BI.
Gebruiken van programmeertalen om geavanceerde analyses uit te voeren. Kennis van Python en/of R is een pre.
Samenwerken met multidisciplinaire teams om inzichten te genereren en aanbevelingen te doen voor verbeteringen.


Wat breng je mee?

Een sterk analytische vermogen om de informatiebehoefte vanuit de organisatie, te vertalen naar waardevolle data- en informatieproducten. Je bent een prettige sparringspartner voor collega’s, die denkt in mogelijkheden.

Verder beschik je over:


Bachelor- of masterdiploma in informatica, data science of een vergelijkbare technische discipline.
Ervaring als Data Engineer, waarbij je hebt gewerkt met Microsoft Azure, SQL Server, (Rest) API's, Power BI.
Kennis van PostgreSQL t.b.v. ontwikkelen op Geo data platform is een pré.
Kennis van SSIS t.b.v. migratie is een pré.
Diepgaand begrip van datamodellering, databases, procedures en gegevensarchitectuur;
Sterke analytische en probleemoplossende vaardigheden.
Uitstekende communicatieve vaardigheden en het vermogen om effectief te communiceren met zowel technische als niet-technische belanghebbenden.
Teamspeler met een proactieve en resultaatgerichte houding.
Je bent bekend met termen CI/CD, Agile/Scrum.
Je werkt en denkt op hbo-niveau.


Wat heeft Veiligheids- en Gezondheidsregio Gelderland-Midden te bieden?

Je krijgt de kans substantiële bijdrage leveren aan de ontwikkeling van ons data platform (Microsoft Azure). Dit is een uitdagende functie binnen een dynamische organisatie die een directe impact heeft op de samenleving. Je hebt de mogelijkheid om te werken met de nieuwste technologieën en tools op het gebied van BI en data-analyse.

Kom werken bij onze organisatie die volop in beweging is! Je komt terecht in een informele organisatie en in betekenisvolle werkomgeving.

Wij zoeken een collega voor minimaal 24 uur per week en wij bieden een salaris van tot maximaal €6.143, - bruto per maand op basis van een 36-urige werkweek (schaal 11, Arbeidsvoorwaarden VGGM). Dit salaris is afhankelijk van jouw ervaring en opleidingsniveau.

Je ontvangt ook een vrij besteedbaar budget: het Individueel Keuze Budget (IKB). Dit is 18,63% over je salaris en biedt jou volop keuzevrijheid en zeggenschap over deze financiële ruimt

Naast deze uitdaging verwachten we ook dat je deelneemt aan het kwaliteitsverbeteringsproces. Je vindt het leuk om nieuwe tooling te leren, maar je denkt ook mee om tooling te verbeteren. Je ziet, we verwachten veel van je! Natuurlijk doe je dit niet alleen. Je werkt in een team met nog 2 professionals. Je werkt volgens de procesafspraken die in het team zijn gemaakt.

het opstellen van vereiste documentatie (schema's, ontwerp en testplannen);
overdracht naar de buitendienst van gemaakte apparatuur;
het beheren van automatiseringsprojecten aan boord van schepen.



Wie ben jij?

Als automation engineer ben jij iemand die graag nauwkeurig en accuraat werkt. Je kent je weg binnen de organisatie en kunt helder en duidelijk communiceren.

Voor deze functie vragen we van jou:


Bachelordiploma Industriële Automatisering, Elektrotechniek;
Kennis van en ervaring met PLC programmering (WAGO/CoDeSys), in IL en ST code en ladderdiagram;
Kennis en vaardigheid om tekeningen te vertalen naar functionele specificaties en werkende Scada/PLC software;
Kennis van SCADA/HMI applicaties, kennis van Citect is een pré aangezien hier veel oude projecten mee gebouwd zijn;
Bereidheid om de nieuwe SCADA software Lynx te leren en bereid om actief bij te dragen aan de verbetering hiervan;
Zowel het werken in teamverband als het zelfstandig werken aan projecten spreekt je aan;
Duidelijke communicatie in Nederlands en Engels;
Je mag werken in Nederland.



Wat krijg je ervoor terug?


Arbeidsvoorwaarden die passen bij je verantwoordelijkheden;
Een organisatie met korte lijnen waar beslissingen snel genomen kunnen worden;
Toegang tot online trainingen in verband met je eigen ontwikkeling;
Minimaal 25 vakantiedagen (bij een fulltime dienstverband);
Extra verlofdagen als je niet ziek wordt;
Mogelijkheid tot thuiswerken (deels thuiswerken is in overleg in een later stadium mogelijk (uiteraard na de inwerkperiode), mits het werk het toelaat).
Dagelijkse goed verzorgde lunch met saladebar;
Reiskostenvergoeding (ons kantoor is bereikbaar met het openbaar vervoer, maar er is ook voldoende parkeergelegenheid);
Goede pensioenregeling waarvoor je als werknemer een lage eigen bijdrage betaalt;
Er worden regelmatig leuke activiteiten met collega's georganiseerd.



Interesse?

In M1 Energia promuoviamo un ambiente di lavoro basato su fiducia, etica e valorizzazione delle risorse.

M1 Energia ti aspetta. Lavora con noi.
At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Power digital products with AI. Work with product teams to identify high-impact opportunities where AI can transform the user experience for millions—and then build the solutions to make them happen. Drive the process from possibility to production, delivering code that’s robust, reproducible, and built for scale.
Explore ways to push the boundaries of our AI capabilities. Stay at the bleeding edge of AI by investigating new models, techniques, and research. Learn fast across new domains, share findings with the team, and turn breakthrough ideas into production systems that deliver real-world impact.
Refine data foundations for exceptional results. Own the full data lifecycle—from acquisition and labeling to loading and management—to ensure our models are trained on clean, high-quality datasets that power top-performing systems.
Own your impact, end-to-end. Set smart priorities, manage execution, and consistently deliver high-quality results, even in ambiguous or fast-changing environments. Balance technical depth with strong ownership, growing your skills while delivering meaningful contributions.


What we look for
Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.
Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer individuals at the start of their career a salary of £83,997 in London and €63,965 in Milan. For a candidate that we assess as possessing considerable relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £110,389 and £194,964 in London, and €105,737 and €143,330 in Milan. Compensation varies by location and expected impact, and grows rapidly as you gain experience and translate it into greater contributions. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work.


Commitment & contract
Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time or part-time.

Location
Milan (Italy), London (UK), Madrid (Spain), Warsaw (Poland) or remote.

About Acast

Since 2014, Acast has been building the world’s most valuable podcast marketplace, creating the technology that connects podcast creators, advertisers, and listeners. Its marketplace spans more than 140,000 podcasts, 3,300 advertisers, and one billion quarterly listens. Crucially, those listens are monetized wherever they happen—across any podcast app or listening platform.

About The Role

We are looking for a Software Engineer for the Acast Intelligence team, specialising in data engineering within the machine learning space. The ideal candidate would be able to build things like a modern recommendation engine, truly understanding it instead of just piecing it together, probably thanks to a solid background in statistics or related fields. We’re after someone who can cut through the hype, focus on real value that LLMs and related tech can bring, and always keep their eyes on the prize: driving growth for our company and our marketplace’s users.

Team’s scope

The team is focused on recommendation systems and intelligent automation. Our product vision is a set of connected systems that turn deep and broad data into decisions and reduce friction, helping one person achieve as much as five would. We build to enable podcast creators to grow their audience, advertisers to be matched to creators, and internal teams to focus on what matters most instead of getting bogged down in chasing data.

This work has a company-wide impact.

Team composition and tools

The team is small but made up of seasoned engineers. We deploy on AWS, and most of our company’s code is in TypeScript, including the infrastructure, but some of this particular team’s code is in Python for the reasons you’d expect. We collaborate on our projects and keep the work process light. Our PM knows the space in and out. We’ve shipped the first version of a recommendation engine, and there’s plenty more in the pipeline. There aren’t many established best practices or ready answers in this field, so the work is a lot about experimentation and learning.

Experience we’re looking for


Background and interest in some of the following: statistics, machine learning, LLMs, recommendation systems, RAG systems (experience with their evaluation is a plus)
Proficiency in Python, familiarity with TypeScript (or the other way around)
Familiarity with vector databases
A habit of staying up to date in a seriously evolving field
Experience with or interest in learning AWS
Experience building software that’s actually delightful for the users
A pragmatic mindset for making sensible trade-offs
Interest in podcasts is really optional, but if you have it, this job will be so much more fun


Logistics

We are remote-first but prefer to have teams in similar timezones; for this team, this means an overlap of at least 4 hours with CET (UTC+1).


For this role we’re hiring within Sweden or UK, and therefore applicants will need to have the right to work in one of these locations.


Culture

Acast is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, national origin or any of the other wonderful characteristics that make us different.

Culture is our number one priority as a business. We believe people come first, and we work every day to enable autonomy, continuous improvement and bring out the best in people. We’re global and have remote teams, so it’s even more important that we strive for an open, inclusive and caring environment where everyone feels visible and welcome.

We consider ourselves a modern organization driven by strong values to create the best, most fulfilling and nurturing culture.

We very much look forward to finding the next great person to join our cause!

Summary (Role Overview):




AquaGuard Technologies is seeking an Applied EO/AI Engineer (AI/ML + Geospatial Analysis) to help develop our Trident GEOINT platform — a dual-use maritime and environmental intelligence system that fuses satellite, aerial and AI analytics.

The platform focuses on automated detection and classification of ADVs (Abandoned, Derelict Vessels) and SUSVs / MUSVs (Small / Medium Uninhabited Surface Vessels), and on identifying maritime anomalies that are hard to detect with conventional systems. These targets can present both environmental and security risks, including smuggling, illegal fishing, espionage, human trafficking, illegal dumping, and the potential weaponisation of uncrewed craft.

Success in this role means building robust ML workflows and data pipelines that improve detection accuracy and provide actionable, responsibly governed situational awareness for environmental agencies and authorised maritime security users.







Key Responsibilities:




Acquire, preprocess, and analyse multi-source EO data (SAR, optical, and aerial) to support vessel and anomaly detection.
Design and automate scalable data pipelines for ingestion, transformation, and versioned storage.
Develop, train, and optimise deep-learning models for detection and classification of ADVs, SUSVs/MUSVs, and related maritime anomalies.
Implement and monitor evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, confidence thresholds) to ensure detection reliability.
Contribute to threat pattern and risk characterisation, differentiating environmental targets (e.g. derelict vessels) from potential security-related anomalies.
Curate and manage datasets using DVC/GitHub for reproducible ML workflows.
Integrate models into cloud-based systems (AWS, GCP) for near-real-time processing and inference.
Collaborate with software and GIS engineers to integrate detection outputs into the Trident GEOINT SaaS platform.
Prepare concise technical documentation, validation reports, and visualisations for internal reviews and project milestones.




Qualifications & Experience:




MSc or PhD in Geoinformatics, Computer Vision, Data Science, or related field.

About Magma

Magma is a startup that has quickly grown to become the leading platform for data-driven math education. By leveraging handwritten solutions in a digital format, Magma allows teachers to place emphasis on creativity in math, while gaining key insights into student progression. This creates a more engaging, inclusive and pedagogical math class for all students.

Math remains the largest challenge for schools, where one in five students are considered low performers. Math is one of the core pillars on which careers are built, and we believe that school math represents one of the largest opportunities at improving educational outcomes and career prospects for children and young adults.

Magma is now growing rapidly across the US and Europe. We are an ambitious team on a meaningful mission of improving math education for millions of children.

The Role

About

We are looking for a builder who wants to help us scale creation and moderation of our math content – meaning math problems, theory, and everything else math-related you might find on a math platform – in ways that will transform the role of a math content creator at Magma, to a math content moderator. In the content team, we have historically had pretty human-intensive content creation processes, no matter if it has been about creating or reviewing problems, aligning already existing content to various educational schemes, or about tagging relevant mathematical skills to problems. As an AI Engineer, you will be part of a team and work towards ensuring that our math content creation processes become a lot more efficient. We are not thinking x2, x3 here, or even x10, but rather x1000. We want to automate as much as possible of our math content creation processes to enable becoming a global company that can operate math content in multiple languages – with high quality – with only a relatively small team of math content moderators. More concretely, below you see a list of projects that you could be expected to work on as part of this role:


Automatically matching Magma subchapters to a list of state standards in the US
Automatically review the math content of a subchapter to ensure that the scope it is intending to have is respected
Automatically generate math problems in line with Magma standards
...


Who You Are And What You Know

We are searching for a team member who wants to take large ownership of Magma's scaling content efforts. To succeed you need to:


Be passionate about building stuff with big impact
Have a big interest in AI and stay up-to-date with the latest releases
Be very ambitious and like chasing challenging targets
Be extremely output-oriented and find satisfaction in driving projects to completion
Eager to learn new things, and have experience of building stuff
Goal-oriented and accustomed to working towards deadlines in a structured manner
Great at communicating
Excellent at giving feedback to others, and adapting to feedback given to you
Be hardworking and willing to join a fast-paced and rapidly growing startup


Requirements


Bachelors degree in any field
Coding skills that enable you to build stuff
Fluent in English


What We Offer


Play a key role in an exciting journey. We are a young company with ambitious targets and meaningful goals
Fantastic colleagues in a fun environment with great opportunities to learn
Full-time job with salary, benefits and stock options
An opportunity to work on a meaningful mission and have an exceptional impact on education, society, and how children learn math across the world.


Start: As soon as possible

Location: Stockholm, Sweden.

Note: We practice a 5 day in office policy, and we look forward to working together closely with you :)

If you have experience building and scaling multi-agentic systems, we would love to speak with you. We just raised from Lightspeed and are currently building out a world-class team.




At Epiminds, we’re building a self-learning marketing team of 20+ autonomous agents working across data, creative, strategy, and execution — all led by Lucy, a super-agent who collaborates with human marketers like a real teammate: reaching out, listening, emailing, and even calling.




Today, 17 agencies and 270 brands leverage our product to save 60 % of their time. We just raised a $6m round from Lightspeed to meet high demand from our users. Lightspeed has also invested in Anthropic, xAI, Mistral, and other decacorns.




Right now, we are focused on continuously improving Lucy and her team. While also closing more deals with customers.




Your role as a founding AI engineer will be to build on the multi-agentic system that powers Lucy today.




Here’s some tasks that you will work on:

Creating new specialist agents

You are prepared to put in the work required for building a category defining product




Why Epiminds

We’re transforming manual marketing into an intelligent, self-evolving system. The next era won’t rely on manual execution, it will be orchestrated by autonomous AI teams that learn, create, and strategize with superhuman precision, speed, and imagination.
We’re a small, high-ownership team from Spotify, Google, and Kry, backed by investors behind Anthropic, xAI and Mistral. We’re here to change the world-not someday, but now.

Observera: Programmet är kostnadsfritt. Första lönen utbetalas retroaktivt efter att konsultuppdraget påbörjats, vilket innebär att du behöver kunna försörja dig under utbildningsperioden.

Vem passar programmet för?

Du har erfarenhet av mjukvaruutveckling, informationssystem, systemimplementationer eller andra tekniknära områden – och vill nu fördjupa dig inom data, AI och molnteknik för att bygga lösningar som driver affären framåt.

Det som betyder mest är din motivation att växa in i en teknisk dataroll och din vilja att bidra till framtidens datadrivna organisationer. Data och AI blir allt viktigare för företag – och om du vill arbeta i centrum av den utvecklingen är du på rätt väg.

Vad gör en Data & AI Engineer?

En Data & AI Engineer är en teknisk problemlösare som ser till att data flödar dit den ska och används på rätt sätt. Du bygger dataplattformar, skapar pipelines och lägger grunden för analys, rapportering och AI-lösningar. Vi ser till att du får lära dig de moderna verktygen – allt du behöver ta med dig är affärsförståelse, nyfikenhet och en stark vilja att lära dig.

A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards.

To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator.

For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate.

A few examples of your responsibilities
Power digital products with AI. Work with product teams to identify high-impact opportunities where AI can transform the user experience for millions—and then build the solutions to make them happen.

Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter.
Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar.
Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent.
Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English.


What we offer
Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field.
An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too.

You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut.
All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location.

About xAI

xAI’s mission is to create AI systems that can accurately understand the universe and aid humanity in its pursuit of knowledge. Our team is small, highly motivated, and focused on engineering excellence. This organization is for individuals who appreciate challenging themselves and thrive on curiosity. We operate with a flat organizational structure. All employees are expected to be hands-on and to contribute directly to the company’s mission. Leadership is given to those who show initiative and consistently deliver excellence. Work ethic and strong prioritization skills are important. All engineers are expected to have strong communication skills. They should be able to concisely and accurately share knowledge with their teammates.

About the Role

xAI was first in the world to build a 100k GPU cluster on an ethernet network and then did it again in 92 days, floors, walls and all. We need an engineer with deep experience in RoCEv2 that can develop at hyper scale while optimizing performance and availability. 

xAI is building at a furious pace with the latest hardware to help people understand the universe. To make the next significant leap forward, we need to own our own destiny by understanding our current network performance and availability and then optimize it to our training models and how we execute customer inference queries. You will spend most of your days deep inside  NCCL, building metric dashboards and tweaking configurations to ensure no performance is left on the table. You will help design the next iteration of our backend and front-end networks that will allow us to seamlessly build-out new GPU infrastructure with little to no engineering assistance.  

There will be a significant amount of travel to Memphis for building more capacity as well as participating in a team on-call rotation and helping on other scaling and maintenance efforts. This will become easier as we build out the team and engineers contribute to deployment and operations frameworks to remove repetitive tasks.

Location

We have 2 openings, one based in Palo Alto, California and the other in Dublin, Ireland. There will be significant travel expected to Memphis, Tennessee for data center buildouts and to the head office in Palo Alto for team collaboration.

Required Qualifications
A minimum of 10 years designing and operating large scale networks with 5 years in the ethernet AI/HPC space.
Deep understanding of congestion control on ethernet with Infiniband an added bonus.
Deep understanding of AI training and inference workloads and how they operate on the network. As part of this you are able to use and debug NCCL and potentially commit to the library.
Expertise in creating a portfolio of metrics for performance and operations to optimize the fleet for training and inference traffic.
Experience with Python to automate away repetitive tasks and facilitate your daily job working with and analyzing large sets of data.
Interview Process

After submitting your application, the team reviews your CV and statement of exceptional work. If your application passes this stage, you will be invited to an initial interview (45 minutes - 1 hour) during which a member of our team will ask some basic questions. If you clear the initial phone interview, you will enter the main process, which consists of five interviews:

Coding assessment in a language of your choice.
Data center network technologies and RoCEv2.
Manager Interview.
Meet and greet with the wider team where you will run through a presentation of a body of work you are proud of.
Benefits

Base salary is just one part of our total rewards package at xAI, which also includes equity, comprehensive medical, vision, and dental coverage, access to a 401(k) retirement plan, short & long-term disability insurance, life insurance, and various other discounts and perks.

xAI is an equal opportunity employer.

Glasskube develops Open Source deployment tools to make engineers more productive. Check out our projects on GitHub github.com/glasskube!

\ You should join Glasskube if any of these are true:


You are fascinated by how the latest technology trends (LLMs, MCP server, Agent mode) are changing the way software developers work.
Debugging and exploring are fun, and you spend way too much time thinking about the inner workings of the tools you use.
You're comfortable automating deployment and monitoring tasks.
You’ve always loved working hands-on in a small and fast-paced team where you can start making an impact on day one.


Tips For The Application


Just write casually, like to your friends :)
We don't care much about your work experience, university, or CV.
Tell us more about your past personal projects, ideas, or any cool things you have done!


Technology

We are building in Go, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL, and we’re committed to open source. Although a lot of AI tooling is already open source, the deployment space still has huge potential to be disrupted.

\ We’re a small team of experienced engineers, and we’re looking for someone with at least a year of hands-on experience who loves building. You don’t need to have a deep DevOps background — just curiosity, initiative, and high intrinsic motivation.

\ If you want to work in Vienna and stay close to the San Francisco startup ecosystem, we’re the right team for you.

Vi søger en passioneret Data Scientist til at arbejde med datadrevne løsninger for vores kunder sammen med resten af vores AI og Data team. Der vil være rig mulighed for at præge opgaverne og skubbe til tingene, så længe argumenterne er i orden.




Her er vores CV




Når nu vi beder dig om et CV, er det vist kun fair, at du også får vores.

Vi hedder Vertica, og vi er en højt specialiseret virksomhed inden for digital forretningsudvikling og ecommerce-løsninger. Vi har mere end 20 års erfaring, og vi har lige nu ansvaret for 150 verticanere fordelt på vores kontorer i hjertet af Aarhus og Kødbyen i København. Vi har lavet prisvindende ecommerce-løsninger for nogle af de største og mest ambitiøse e-handelsvirksomheder i Danmark såsom Søstrene Grene, Brødrene Dahl, Hørkram og Louis Poulsen. Arbejde, der kræver bred faglig viden om alt fra teknisk forretningsudvikling, softwareudvikling og QA til projektledelse, UX og digitalt design. Vi tror meget på vigtigheden af en god arbejdskultur, og vi er stolte af at have bygget en, der beror på faglig stolthed, videndeling, personlig udvikling og flere sociale arrangementer, end du nogensinde får tid til.

Så vi kan lidt af hvert, og vi synes, du skal vælge os.




Din nye hverdag




Som en del af vores AI og Data-team arbejder du sammen med et team af kolleger med forskellig baggrund og kompetencer. Det, der binder jer sammen, er jeres store interesse for data, AI og forretningsudvikling – og hvordan vi i Vertica kan hjælpe vores kunder med at omsætte data til vigtige indsigter, som kan være med til at flytte og styrke vores kunders forretning. I din rolle kommer du med det rette data på det rette tidspunkt og i den rette kvalitet. Du skaber således et stærkt fundament for, at vores kunder har nem adgang til at arbejde med data. Da vi er en konsulentvirksomhed, vil vores opgaver variere afhængigt af vores kunders behov. Dog kan vi fortælle, at vores fokus er at udvikle AI løsninger til ecommerce, hvor vi laver alt fra conversational agents til dynamisk prissætning.




Vi forestiller os, at du skal arbejde med følgende.

Designe, bygge og levere værdiskabende AI løsninger til en bred række af kunder i samarbejde med resten af AI og Data teamet
Være med til at finde de bedste løsninger baseret på kundernes ønsker og behov
Udvikle og implementere robuste metoder til evaluering og overvågning, så vi sikrer høj kvalitet i vores løsninger.
Udvikle produktionsklar Python kode
Bidrage til at definere best practices og standarder for data science i organisationen
Følge og arbejde på projekter fra start til slut samt endeligt at sætte løsningen i produktion




Dit fundament




Vi forestiller os, at du har minimum 3 års relevant erhvervserfaring samt har et solidt teknisk grundlag og evnerne og forståelsen for at drive processer fra start til slut. Men vigtigst af alt er, at du er passioneret omkring AI og har lyst til at drive vores forretning til nye højder sammen med resten af teamet.

Det er et plus, hvis du har erfaring med hele machine learning lifecycle eller har erfaring med at arbejde med forskellige dataplatforme.




Derudover lægger vi vægt på, at:

Du har erfaring som konsulent og motiveres af at arbejde med AI projekter samt hjælpe kunder med at finde den bedste løsning til deres udfordringer
Du har erfaring med at sætte machine learning modeller eller AI løsninger i produktion
Du har stærke færdigheder og god erfaring med Python
Du har flair og interesse for at arbejde med en bred vifte af AI løsninger




Fik vi nævnt…




At vi ikke har nogen chefer. Her er der ingen, der bestemmer, hvordan du skal arbejde. Vi har sat beslutningerne fri, så dem der har faglighed og kompetence selv bestemmer, hvordan de løser opgaverne. Det betyder, at du og dit team får mulighed for at indrette jeres arbejde, sådan som I mener, det er bedst.




At gennemsigtighed er en af kerneværdierne i Vertica, og derfor ligger vores personalehåndbog frit tilgængeligt online. I personalehåndbogen kan du læse, hvilke vilkår vi - og alle vores fremtidige kolleger - arbejder under. Hvis ikke du har tid til at læse hele håndbogen igennem, så har vi fremhævet nogle af dem, vi sætter særligt pris på.




At vi tror på livslang læring: Vi går i livets skole, men af og til er der også kurser, konferencer eller uddannelser, som man kan lære af. Er der noget, du gerne vil blive klogere på, har du muligheden for at videreuddanne dig i Vertica. Vi har intet loft på uddannelsesbudgettet, så der heller ikke er loft på læringen.




At vi er hamrende sociale: Vi holder af sociale arrangementer, og vi holder mange af dem. Det kan være alt fra klatring, padeltennis, byg-dit-eget-tastatur og cocktail-kursus til familietur i Djurs Sommerland. Derudover tager vi hvert år på en firmaweekend, hvor vi har fokus på hygge, god mad og socialt samvær.

Din bakgrunn

Vi ser etter deg som har:


Mastergrad eller tilsvarende innenfor journalistikk, statistikk, datavitenskap, økonometri, informatikk eller et annet relevant kvantitativt felt.
Solid erfaring fra bruk av ML/KI-verktøy på forskjellige data som tekst, lyd, bilder og tidsserier.
Dypgående kompetanse i statistiske metoder og modellering.
Meget god kunnskap i Python og relevante biblioteker (f.eks. Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, etc), og SQL.
Evne til å omsette innsikt og teknologi til løsninger som faktisk løser reelle redaksjonelle behov.
Sterke kommunikasjonsevner – både på norsk og engelsk.
Liker å holde deg oppdatert på fagfeltet innen tradisjonelle forskningsmetoder, ML og AI.
