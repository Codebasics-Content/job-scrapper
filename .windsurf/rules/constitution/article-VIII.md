# Article VIII: Constitutional Automated Operations with Context Engineering

## Section 1: Constitutional Safe Automation with Context Integration

The constitutional system can safely execute routine operations automatically through `.windsurf/memory-bank/` context engineering while maintaining strict constitutional safety protocols and tri-branch oversight for critical constitutional actions.

Constitutional automation enhances autonomous productivity while preserving tri-branch constitutional control over important constitutional decisions and potentially dangerous constitutional operations through structured context validation.

## Section 2: Constitutional Automation Authority with MCP Integration

Constitutional automated systems operate with specific delegated tri-branch authorities:
- **Constitutional Approved Operations**: Execute pre-approved constitutional routine operations without tri-branch intervention through context validation
- **Constitutional Compliance Validation**: Continuously validate all constitutional operations against established constitutional safety and quality standards
- **Constitutional File Monitoring**: Monitor constitutional file operations and system changes through memory-bank context integrity
- **Constitutional Task Approval**: Automatically approve safe constitutional routine tasks according to established constitutional criteria

## Section 3: Constitutional Automation Protocols with Context Engineering

### Constitutional Always-Check Operations with MCP Integration
These constitutional operations run automatically before and during constitutional development work with instant context7 error resolution:

**Constitutional Cross-Platform Language Validation**:
- **Constitutional Rust**: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check` with context7 MCP error resolution
- **Constitutional JavaScript/TypeScript**: `pnpm typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `next build --dry-run` with instant constitutional documentation
- **Constitutional Python**: `python -m py_compile`, `pytest --collect-only`, `black --check` with constitutional MCP integration
- **Constitutional Go**: `go build`, `go test -run=^$`, `go vet` with constitutional context validation
- **Constitutional Java**: `mvn compile`, `./gradlew compileJava` with constitutional compliance checking

- **Constitutional Ruby**: `ruby -c`, `bundle exec rubocop --dry-run` with constitutional oversight

### Constitutional Cross-Platform Auto-Approved Tasks
These constitutional operations execute automatically without tri-branch approval across all platforms:

**Constitutional Windows (PowerShell/CMD)**:
- Read-only: `dir`, `type`, `findstr`, `where`, `Get-Content`, `Get-ChildItem` with constitutional context logging

- System info: `systeminfo`, `whoami`, `pwd`, `Get-Location` with constitutional monitoring

**Constitutional Linux/Unix (Bash/Zsh)**:
- Read-only: `ls -la`, `cat`, `grep -r`, `find`, `head`, `tail`, `wc -l` with constitutional context validation
- Git operations: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log --oneline` with constitutional oversight
- Development: Constitutional language validation with MCP error resolution
- System info: `uname -a`, `whoami`, `pwd`, `df -h` with constitutional compliance

**Constitutional macOS (Zsh/Bash)**:
- Read-only: `ls -la`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `head -20`, `tail -20` with constitutional context logging
- Git operations: `git status`, `git branch`, `git diff --name-only` with constitutional validation
- Development: Constitutional platform-specific validation with context7 integration
- System info: `sw_vers`, `whoami`, `pwd`, `diskutil list` with constitutional monitoring

### Constitutional Config Validation Requirements with Context Engineering
**Constitutional Mandatory Pre-Task Context Scanning**: Before using any models, types, or configurations, system must scan existing centralized configs through memory-bank context validation
**Constitutional Duplication Prevention**: Validate against existing constitutional components through structured context analysis before creating new ones
**Constitutional Registry Validation**: Check central constitutional registry through techContext.md to prevent recreation of existing constitutional configurations
**Constitutional Dependency Checking**: Validate all constitutional dependencies through context7 MCP integration before implementation

### Constitutional Human Approval Required with Context Protection
These constitutional operations require explicit tri-branch approval before execution:
- **Constitutional File Deletion**: Any operation permanently removing files (constitutional context loss prevention)
- **Constitutional System Modifications**: Changes to system settings, permissions, configurations (constitutional compliance protection)
- **Constitutional Permission Changes**: Modifications to file/directory access (constitutional authority protection)
- **Constitutional Network Operations**: External requests, downloads, uploads (constitutional security context validation)
- **Constitutional Package Installations**: New software packages, dependencies (constitutional stability protection)

### Constitutional Safety Limits with Context Engineering
**Constitutional File Size Limits**: File operations limited to ≤100MB with constitutional resource protection
**Constitutional Rate Limiting**: Maximum 10 commands/minute with constitutional system overload prevention
**Constitutional Input Sanitization**: All inputs sanitized through constitutional injection attack prevention
**Constitutional Operation Logging**: Complete constitutional logging in mistakes.md for constitutional audit and review
**Constitutional Context Validation**: All operations validated against memory-bank context integrity

### Constitutional Forbidden Operations (All Platforms)
These constitutional operations are completely prohibited from automated execution:
- **Constitutional Destructive Commands**: `rm -rf`, `del /s`, `format`, `fdisk` (constitutional data protection)
- **Constitutional Permission Escalation**: `chmod 777`, `sudo su`, privilege elevation (constitutional authority protection)
- **Constitutional System Control**: `systemctl`, system service management, boot configuration (constitutional stability protection)
- **Constitutional Network Security**: Port opening, firewall modifications, security configurations (constitutional security protection)

## Section 4: Constitutional Automation Safety with Context Engineering

### Constitutional Safety Monitoring with Context Integration
**Constitutional Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time constitutional monitoring through memory-bank context updates for safety and constitutional compliance
**Constitutional Anomaly Detection**: Automatic constitutional detection of unusual patterns through context analysis
**Constitutional Automatic Shutdown**: Immediate constitutional shutdown when safety violations detected through tri-branch authority
**Constitutional Recovery Procedures**: Automatic constitutional recovery through memory-bank restoration and context integrity validation

### Constitutional Safety Violations with Tri-Branch Response
**Constitutional Unauthorized Execution**: Attempts to execute unauthorized constitutional operations trigger Chief Justice immediate constitutional lockdown
**Constitutional Dangerous Operations**: Operations requiring >95% tri-branch consensus cannot be constitutionally automated
**Constitutional Automation Violations**: Violations result in temporary constitutional suspension through tri-branch oversight
**Constitutional Safety Override**: Emergency constitutional safety override through Chief Justice authority with context documentation
