# Article VIII: Constitutional Automated Operations with Context Engineering

## Section 1: Constitutional Safe Automation with Context Integration

The constitutional system can safely execute routine operations automatically through `.windsurf/memory-bank/` context engineering while maintaining strict constitutional safety protocols and tri-branch oversight for critical constitutional actions.

Constitutional automation enhances autonomous productivity while preserving tri-branch constitutional control over important constitutional decisions and potentially dangerous constitutional operations through structured context validation.

## Section 2: Automation Authority with Autonomous MCP Integration

Automated systems operate with delegated tri-branch authorities:
- **Approved Operations**: Execute pre-approved routine operations without tri-branch intervention through context validation
- **Compliance Validation**: Continuously validate operations against safety and quality standards
- **File Monitoring**: Monitor file operations and system changes through memory-bank context integrity
- **Task Approval**: Automatically approve safe routine tasks according to established criteria

## Section 3: Constitutional Automation Protocols with Context Engineering

### Always-Check Operations with Autonomous MCP Integration
These operations run automatically before and during development work with auto-call @mcp:context7 error resolution:

**Cross-Platform Language Validation**:
- **Rust**: `cargo check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo fmt --check` with auto-call @mcp:context7
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: `pnpm typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `next build --dry-run` with auto-call @mcp:context7
- **Python**: `python -m py_compile`, `pytest --collect-only`, `black --check` with auto-call @mcp:context7
- **Go**: `go build`, `go test -run=^$`, `go vet` with auto-call @mcp:context7
- **Java**: `mvn compile`, `./gradlew compileJava` with auto-call @mcp:context7
- **C#**: `dotnet build --no-restore`, `dotnet format --verify-no-changes` with auto-call @mcp:context7
- **PHP**: `php -l`, `composer validate`, `phpstan analyse` with auto-call @mcp:context7
- **Ruby**: `ruby -c`, `bundle exec rubocop --dry-run` with auto-call @mcp:context7

### Cross-Platform Auto-Approved Tasks
These operations execute automatically without tri-branch approval across all platforms:

**Windows (PowerShell/CMD)**:
- Read-only: `dir`, `type`, `findstr`, `where`, `Get-Content`, `Get-ChildItem` with context logging
- Git operations: `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git branch` with auto-call @mcp:git
- Development: Language validation commands with auto-call @mcp:context7
- System info: `systeminfo`, `whoami`, `pwd`, `Get-Location`

**Linux/Unix (Bash/Zsh)**:
- Read-only: `ls -la`, `cat`, `grep -r`, `find`, `head`, `tail`, `wc -l` with context validation
- Git operations: `git status`, `git diff --stat`, `git log --oneline` with auto-call @mcp:git
- Development: Language validation with auto-call @mcp:context7
- System info: `uname -a`, `whoami`, `pwd`, `df -h`

**macOS (Zsh/Bash)**:
- Read-only: `ls -la`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`, `head -20`, `tail -20` with context logging
- Git operations: `git status`, `git branch`, `git diff --name-only` with auto-call @mcp:git
- Development: Platform-specific validation with auto-call @mcp:context7
- System info: `sw_vers`, `whoami`, `pwd`, `diskutil list`

### Config Validation Requirements with Context Engineering
**Mandatory Pre-Task Context Scanning**: Scan existing centralized configs through memory-bank context validation
**Duplication Prevention**: Validate against existing components through structured context analysis
**Registry Validation**: Check central registry through techContext.md to prevent recreation
**Dependency Checking**: Validate all dependencies via auto-call @mcp:context7 before implementation

### Human Approval Required with Context Protection
These operations require explicit tri-branch approval before execution:
- **File Deletion**: Any operation permanently removing files (context loss prevention)
- **System Modifications**: Changes to system settings, permissions, configurations (compliance protection)
- **Permission Changes**: Modifications to file/directory access (authority protection)
- **Network Operations**: External requests, downloads, uploads (security context validation)
- **Package Installations**: New software packages, dependencies (stability protection)

### Safety Limits with Context Engineering
**File Size Limits**: File operations limited to ≤100MB with resource protection
**Rate Limiting**: Maximum 10 commands/minute with system overload prevention
**Input Sanitization**: All inputs sanitized through injection attack prevention
**Operation Logging**: Complete logging in mistakes.md for audit and review
**Context Validation**: All operations validated against memory-bank context integrity

### Forbidden Operations (All Platforms)
These operations are completely prohibited from automated execution:
- **Destructive Commands**: `rm -rf`, `del /s`, `format`, `fdisk` (data protection)
- **Permission Escalation**: `chmod 777`, `sudo su`, privilege elevation (authority protection)
- **System Control**: `systemctl`, system service management, boot configuration (stability protection)
- **Network Security**: Port opening, firewall modifications, security configurations (security protection)

## Section 4: Constitutional Automation Safety with Context Engineering

### Constitutional Safety Monitoring with Context Integration
**Constitutional Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time constitutional monitoring through memory-bank context updates for safety and constitutional compliance
**Constitutional Anomaly Detection**: Automatic constitutional detection of unusual patterns through context analysis
**Constitutional Automatic Shutdown**: Immediate constitutional shutdown when safety violations detected through tri-branch authority
**Constitutional Recovery Procedures**: Automatic constitutional recovery through memory-bank restoration and context integrity validation

### Constitutional Safety Violations with Tri-Branch Response
**Constitutional Unauthorized Execution**: Attempts to execute unauthorized constitutional operations trigger Chief Justice immediate constitutional lockdown
**Constitutional Dangerous Operations**: Operations requiring >95% tri-branch consensus cannot be constitutionally automated
**Constitutional Automation Violations**: Violations result in temporary constitutional suspension through tri-branch oversight
**Constitutional Safety Override**: Emergency constitutional safety override through Chief Justice authority with context documentation

### Constitutional Audit and Review with Context Engineering
**Constitutional Operation Logs**: Comprehensive constitutional logging in mistakes.md and systemPatterns.md with timestamps and constitutional outcomes
**Constitutional Regular Audits**: Periodic tri-branch review through progress.md analysis and constitutional safety compliance
**Constitutional Performance Analysis**: Analysis through memory-bank context effectiveness and constitutional improvement identification
**Constitutional Safety Updates**: Regular constitutional updates to safety protocols through roadmap strategic planning and constitutional lessons learned

## Section 5: Constitutional Automated Command Integration with Context Engineering

### Constitutional Core Automated Commands
**`what next`** - Constitutional Executive Automated Authority:
1. **Auto-read entire memory-bank** (8 files) + roadmap for complete constitutional context assembly
2. **Auto-analyze constitutional priorities** through tri-branch requirements and context validation

4. **Auto-trigger implementation** with constitutional oversight and safety validation

**`implement next task`** - Constitutional Development Minister Automated Authority:

2. **Auto-execute with full context** through memory-bank awareness and tri-branch compliance
3. **Auto-integrate MCP requirements** (auto-call @mcp servers WITHOUT asking) for standards and instant error resolution
4. **Auto-continue execution** under constitutional oversight with safety monitoring

**`update memory bank`** - Constitutional Context Automated Authority:
