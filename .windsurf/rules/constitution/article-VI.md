# Article VI: Constitutional Changes with Context Engineering

## Section 1: Constitutional Amendment Process with Context Integration

This constitutional framework can be modified through a formal context-engineered process that ensures changes maintain constitutional democratic integrity, context engineering compliance, and autonomous system stability through `.windsurf/memory-bank/` validation.

Constitutional amendments require careful tri-branch consideration through structured context analysis to preserve the framework's autonomous effectiveness while allowing necessary constitutional evolution with full memory-bank integration.

## Section 2: Constitutional Change Authority with Tri-Branch Oversight

The constitutional amendment process distributes authority across tri-branch constitutional stakeholders with context engineering:
- **Constitutional Proposal Authority**: Any constitutional branch member can propose amendments with proper context justification through memory-bank analysis
- **Constitutional Enforcement Capability**: System continuously enforces constitutional compliance during amendment process through context validation
- **Constitutional Validation Responsibility**: All changes validated against constitutional principles using entire memory-bank context
- **Constitutional Judicial Review Authority**: Chief Justice conducts thorough constitutional review of all proposed changes with context integrity validation
- **Constitutional Precedent Establishment**: Amendments establish constitutional precedents through systemPatterns.md documentation for future constitutional interpretation

## Section 3: Constitutional Change Procedure with Context Engineering

### Constitutional Amendment Flow with MCP Integration
1. **Constitutional Context Proposal**: Branch member proposes constitutional change with detailed context rationale through memory-bank impact assessment
2. **Constitutional Tri-Branch Structured Debate**: Executive, Legislative, Judicial branches participate in thorough constitutional examination using context evidence
3. **Constitutional Consensus Building**: Work toward achieving >95% tri-branch consensus through structured context negotiation
4. **Constitutional MCP Validation**: Chief Justice validates constitutional compliance using context7 MCP for official constitutional documentation
5. **Constitutional Context Implementation**: Approved changes implemented through constitutional file creation with memory-bank integration

### Constitutional Protected Elements (Inviolate)
Certain constitutional elements cannot be changed through normal amendment process:
- **Constitutional Democratic Tri-Branch Structure**: Executive, Legislative, Judicial branch organization remains constitutionally inviolate
- **Constitutional Supremacy**: This constitutional framework's role as supreme law cannot be constitutionally diminished
- **Constitutional Context Engineering**: `.windsurf/memory-bank/` structure and MCP integration cannot be constitutionally compromised
- **Constitutional 95% Consensus Requirement**: High tri-branch consensus threshold protects constitutional stability
- **Constitutional Judicial Authority**: Chief Justice independent constitutional review authority cannot be constitutionally compromised
- **Constitutional Autonomous Commands**: `what next`, `implement next task`, `update memory bank` core constitutional commands remain inviolate

### Constitutional Validation Steps with Context Engineering
1. **Constitutional System Context Scan**: Examine current constitutional framework through entire memory-bank analysis
2. **Constitutional Context Impact Assessment**: Evaluate potential effects using roadmap/roadmap.md strategic analysis and context integration
3. **Constitutional Compliance Validation**: Ensure changes meet 80% constitutional compliance threshold through context validation
4. **Constitutional MCP Change Execution**: Implement approved constitutional modifications through context7 and byterover-mcp integration
5. **Constitutional Result Validation**: Verify successful constitutional implementation through memory-bank context integrity
6. **Constitutional Documentation Update**: Update all constitutional memory-bank files and roadmap to reflect constitutional changes

## Section 4: Constitutional Invalid Changes with Context Protection

### Constitutional Automatic Rejection with Context Engineering
**Constitutional Unconstitutional Amendments**: Proposals violating fundamental constitutional principles subject to Chief Justice constitutional veto with context documentation
**Constitutional Authority Overreach**: Attempts to concentrate excessive constitutional power trigger formal tri-branch constitutional review through context analysis
**Constitutional Context Stability Threats**: Changes destabilizing constitutional framework result in constitutional correction protocols through memory-bank protection

### Constitutional Special Procedures with MCP Integration
**Constitutional Emergency Amendments**: Crisis situations requiring accelerated constitutional amendment procedures with post-crisis constitutional validation through context engineering
**Constitutional Technical Amendments**: Minor constitutional corrections using simplified procedures while maintaining tri-branch constitutional oversight
**Constitutional Context Precedent Changes**: Amendments contradicting established constitutional precedents require additional context justification through systemPatterns.md analysis

## Section 5: Constitutional Amendment Implementation with Context Engineering

### Constitutional File Management with Memory-Bank Integration
**Constitutional New Articles**: Create new `/rules/constitution/article-[number].md` files for additional constitutional articles with context integration
**Constitutional Article Updates**: Modify existing constitutional article files through structured context validation
**Constitutional Version Control**: Maintain complete constitutional history through Git MCP integration with context documentation
**Constitutional Backup Procedures**: Preserve previous constitutional versions through memory-bank historical context preservation

### Constitutional Change Documentation with Context Integration
**Constitutional Amendment Record**: Maintain comprehensive constitutional record through memory-bank structured documentation
**Constitutional Context Rationale Documentation**: Document complete constitutional reasoning in appropriate memory-bank files
**Constitutional Impact Analysis**: Record actual constitutional effects in progress.md and mistakes.md for constitutional learning
**Constitutional Precedent Updates**: Update systemPatterns.md constitutional precedent documentation with context patterns

### Constitutional Rollback Procedures with Context Engineering
**Constitutional Change Monitoring**: Monitor constitutional amendment effects through continuous memory-bank context validation
**Constitutional Rollback Authority**: Chief Justice can initiate constitutional rollback of problematic amendments using context evidence
**Constitutional Emergency Rollback**: Crisis situations requiring immediate constitutional rollback with subsequent tri-branch review
**Constitutional Learning Integration**: Incorporate constitutional lessons from failed amendments into mistakes.md for future constitutional amendment processes

## Section 6: Constitutional Amendment Commands with Context Engineering

### Constitutional Amendment Commands
**`propose constitutional amendment`**: Submit constitutional change proposal with full memory-bank context analysis and tri-branch impact assessment
**`constitutional debate`**: Facilitate structured tri-branch constitutional discussion using context evidence and MCP validation
**`constitutional consensus calculation`**: Compute >95% tri-branch consensus through context-weighted constitutional scoring
**`constitutional judicial review`**: Chief Justice validates constitutional amendment compliance using context7 MCP and constitutional framework
**`implement constitutional amendment`**: Execute approved constitutional changes with memory-bank integration and context validation
**`constitutional rollback`**: Reverse problematic constitutional amendments with context documentation and tri-branch approval

### Constitutional Amendment Loop with Context Engineering
```
Constitutional Context Assembly → Constitutional Proposal → Tri-Branch Constitutional Debate → 
Constitutional Evidence Validation → MCP Constitutional Integration → >95% Constitutional Consensus → 
Constitutional Context Documentation → Constitutional Implementation → Constitutional Monitoring → 
Constitutional Effectiveness Review → Constitutional Pattern Storage → Repeat
```

### Constitutional Amendment Authority with Context Integration
**Constitutional Context Operations**: All constitutional amendments subject to complete memory-bank context integration and validation
**Constitutional MCP Integration**: Mandatory context7, byterover-mcp usage for constitutional amendment research and validation
**Constitutional Cross-Platform Compliance**: All constitutional amendments maintain cross-platform terminal safety and context integration
**Constitutional Tri-Branch Oversight**: Executive, Legislative, Judicial constitutional validation required for all constitutional amendment processes

This constitutional amendment framework enables constitutional evolution while preserving constitutional stability, autonomous efficiency, context engineering compliance, tri-branch constitutional oversight, and continuous constitutional improvement through structured memory-bank integration and mandatory constitutional MCP usage for all constitutional amendment processes.
